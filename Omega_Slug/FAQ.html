       <h3>Who are we and why did we create this game? </h3>
       <p>We are 4 students from Uskudar University studying computer science, trying to <br> Develop a game
         for the sake of improving  ourselves and finishing our software internship :)</p>
       <h3> How much time did you spend developing the game? </h3>
       <p> We spent approximately 1 month on the game. Including the webpage (Which is made by us).</p>
       <h3> Which programming language and engine <br> did you use for developing the project? </h3>
        <p>We used Unity Engine for the game development which uses C# as it's programming language. <br>
             The website was created using HTML/CSS/JS (and additional frameworks) <br>
            The assets in game were created using illustration <br> softwares such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop etc. </p>
       <h3> How much time did it cost you to develop the game? </h3>
       <p>It didn't cost much. 90% of the assets used in the game were created by us. <br> 
        The bought ones were either very cheap or free. 
         Game engine was also free because <br> of us being students.The only cost was the domain and the hosting for the website</p>

         <h3>Did you have fun while developing the project?</h3>
         <p>Yes! We had a lot of fun trying to solve the bugs and the errors together. <br>
         Although we had some troubles on the way trying to solve the problems,<br> we managed to get over them 
        and finish the project successfully. <br>Overall this project was a very great,instructive and pleasurable experience</p>
